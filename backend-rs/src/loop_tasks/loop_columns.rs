//! SQLAlchemy-labeled `loop_items` projections shared by the loop-item reads.
//!
//! The source selects the full mapped `loop_items` entity for
//! `db.query(LoopItem...)` and for the task-binding queries, rendering one
//! `<table>_<column>` alias per mapped column. The statements stay in the
//! repository modules; only the projection text lives here so a projection
//! change cannot drift between reads.

/// The source's full column projection for `find_cloud_context`
/// (`db.query(LoopItemTaskBinding)` labeled like SQLAlchemy's query rendering).
/// Selected to match the recorded statement; the typed row consumes only the
/// response fields.
