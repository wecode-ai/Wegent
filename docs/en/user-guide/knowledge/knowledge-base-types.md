## 🔄 Choosing the Right Type

### Choose Notebook Mode When:

- You have fewer than 50 documents
- You need interactive chat within the knowledge base
- You want to select specific documents for context
- You're doing research or Q&A sessions

### Choose Classic Mode When:

- You have more than 50 documents
- You primarily need document storage and retrieval
- You're building a large archive
- You'll access via agents rather than direct chat

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Type Cannot Be Changed

Once a knowledge base is created, its type cannot be changed. Choose carefully based on your needs.

### Document Limit Enforcement

Notebook mode enforces a 50-document limit. If you need more documents, create a Classic mode knowledge base.

### Migration

To migrate from Notebook to Classic (or vice versa):

1. Create a new knowledge base with the desired type
2. Re-upload documents to the new knowledge base
3. Delete the old knowledge base (optional)
