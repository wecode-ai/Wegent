## 🎯 Currently Available Features

While the dedicated AI Coding module is under development, you can use AI for coding through the following methods:

### Via Task Management

1. Go to [Managing Tasks](../ai-chat/managing-tasks.md)
2. Create a coding task
3. Select an appropriate agent team (e.g., fullstack-dev-team)
4. Describe your coding requirements
5. AI will execute the coding task in the specified workspace

### Supported Coding Task Types

- **Feature Development**: Implement new features
- **Bug Fixing**: Locate and fix code issues
- **Code Refactoring**: Optimize code structure and performance
- **Test Writing**: Write unit tests and integration tests
- **Documentation Writing**: Generate code documentation and API docs

### Example Task Description

```
Please implement a user login feature, including:
1. Frontend login page (React + TypeScript)
2. Backend API (FastAPI)
3. JWT authentication
4. Unit tests (coverage >80%)
```
