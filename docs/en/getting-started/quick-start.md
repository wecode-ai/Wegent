---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system has:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

---

## ⚡ One-Click Start

## 📦 Built-in Agents

| Team | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| chat-team | General AI assistant + Mermaid diagrams |
| translator | Multi-language translation |
| dev-team | Git workflow: branch → code → commit → PR |
| wiki-team | Codebase Wiki documentation generation |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js) → Backend (FastAPI) → Executor Manager → Executors (ClaudeCode/Dify/Chat)
```

**Core Concepts:**
- **Ghost** (prompt) + **Shell** (environment) + **Model** = **Bot**
- Multiple **Bots** + **Collaboration Mode** = **Team**
